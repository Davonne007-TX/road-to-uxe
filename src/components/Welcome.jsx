        What have I done this year? In 2024, I built a series of UI Projects in
        React.js and Tailwind CSS v3. I was in the mindset of design meets code.
        I wanted to build my React skills and combine it with my love for
        design.

        There is definitely more to learn when it comes to design, responsive
        design, and clean code. There are many things I do not know about
        React.js but I do know how to get started. No project is ever finished
        and I know I will come back to these projects in the future. Thanks for
        visiting.
