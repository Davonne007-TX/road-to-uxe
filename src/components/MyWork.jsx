          My year in a nutshell. This is my body of work for 2024. It has been a
          learning experience with React.js and Tailwind CSS with all the bugs
          and styling issues I ran into. There is definitely more to learn when
          it comes to design and clean code. There are many things I do not know
          about React.js but I do know how to get started.
